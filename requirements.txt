✅ 1. ResNet-50

    Deep residual network

    Robust and widely used for classification

✅ 2. EfficientNet-B0

    Smaller and faster

    Good accuracy-speed tradeoff

✅ 3. DenseNet-121

    Densely connected CNN

    Efficient parameter usage


    ✅ How to choose which one to use:

In your scripts/run_training.py, you probably have something like:

    
    MODEL_NAME = "resnet50"
     
    MODEL_NAME = "efficientnet_b0"
    
    MODEL_NAME = "densenet121"

Just change it to: before running training.

🎯 First: What you are using
The architectures in your project (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0) are all convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
✅ They are not something different from CNNs—they are specific advanced CNN architectures.

Here’s how they fit:

Model Name	        Type	    Year	Notes
ResNet-50	        CNN	        2015	Deep residual blocks (skip connections), classic
DenseNet-121	    CNN	        2016	Dense connections between layers, efficient
EfficientNet-B0	    CNN	        2019	Compound scaling, state-of-the-art efficiency


using CNNs—just not the most basic ones (like plain VGG or LeNet). You’re using more modern, deeper CNNs.


🧠 Why not use basic CNNs?
When you say "what about CNN", you probably mean a plain stack of Conv → ReLU → Pool layers.
This can work for small datasets or academic exercises, but:

❌ For large and complex datasets like ISIC (~33,000 images), plain CNNs are almost always outperformed by ResNet/DenseNet/EfficientNet.

✅ These architectures:

Solve vanishing gradient problems

Have skip connections or dense connections

Are pretrained on ImageNet

Generalize better to medical images


trending (2023–2024–2025)?
Besides these CNNs, the field is moving towards transformers and hybrid architectures:

        Vision Transformer (ViT)

        Swin Transformer

        ConvNeXt (CNN with transformer-like improvements)

But note:
✅ They are more computationally expensive
✅ For many projects, EfficientNet and ResNet still perform extremely well
